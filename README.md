This application allows users to upload an image and apply various edge detection and segmentation algorithms to it. The results are displayed visually for comparison.

The application demonstrates several common computer vision techniques, including:

•

Edge Detection: Sobel, Scharr, Laplacian, Canny, Roberts, Prewitt operators.

•

Segmentation: Otsu's Thresholding, K-Means Clustering, HSV Color Space Segmentation, MTCNN Face Detection, Haar Cascade Face Detection.

The primary goal is to provide an interactive tool for visualizing the effects of different image processing algorithms on user-provided images, particularly focusing on facial features where applicable.
